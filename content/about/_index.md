Greetings! 
I'm Heng-Sheng Chang, an insatiable explorer of both mind and world. 
My journey of discovery began with an early passion for advanced science, technology, and innovation --- an enthusiasm that has only grown stronger over time.

Fascinated by science fiction, I've always been captivated by its power to inspire us to think beyond the boundaries of what's currently possible. 
I believe that by harnessing the creative and imaginative concepts from sci-fi and using them to propel scientific research, we can transform seemingly far-fetched ideas into tangible realities.

My approach to discovery involves embracing calculated risks and thinking beyond conventional boundaries. 
I'm constantly seeking to push the limits of what we consider achievable, driven by the belief that true innovation often lies just beyond our comfort zone.

In essence, I'm a lifelong discoverer, always eager to unravel the world's mysteries and expand the horizons of possibility. 
Each day brings new opportunities to learn, grow, and evolve --- and I'm here to seize them all with open arms and an adventurous spirit.
